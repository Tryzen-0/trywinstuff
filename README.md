This repo contains: Software, Tweaks, Tips and Tricks that I have used to make Windows more enjoyable. (As a linux user.)<br>
Here's everything I did so far:
- Downloading + Installing Windows 10/11 Manually to skip OOBE + (optional and for advanced users) adjust some settings before even having a user account
- Scoop to install cool software.
- Use the cool software to remove bloat.
- Replace some windows components with better alternatives. (like replace Zune Music + Media player legacy /w MPV)
- and more!
guides n stuff coming soon!
